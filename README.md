Welcome to the GINA Cesium Demo ReadMe.


HOW TO's:
You can access the web demo by going to:

Operation should be intuitive, as it behaves about the same as google earth/maps.

The buttons at the bottom of the screen activate funtions. These functions will either place your viewpoint onto a specific area, load in data or tiles, or both.

The full screen button is in the bottom right hand corner.

If you're using a VR device such as the Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard, click the glasses button for VR mode.

The bottom left hand corner features time control settings. You should be able to see the earth rotate if you zoom out enough. 

CREDITS:
This demo uses multiple sources of geographic tiles and information provided by GINA.

The world map tiles can be found here: http://tiles.gina.alaska.edu/tiles/info/bdl

The 1955 Northern Test Case Aireal Imagery tiles can be found here: http://tiles.gina.alaska.edu/tiles/info/epscor_ntc_epscor_northern_historical_usgs_1955_geo

Outlines of the Northern Test Case Lakes provided by Roberta Walker can be found in a GeoJson format here: https://alaska113.github.io/lakes.txt

Demo created by GINA intern, Khan Howe.

FUTURE WORK:
-If someone were to create a union between this demo and the Unity demo, it would be a very powerful tool. My original plan after experimenting with both was to have an area selection and display tool made with Cesium that then creates a 3D surface terrain map on unity. I unfotunatly could not make it to this step.

-A better interface and live updated information would be a great use of Cesium. An example of this type of interface can be found here: http://science.nasa.gov/iSat/?group=SMD

-Load in more interesting data provided by GINA, EPSCoR, and their partners. This could include historical climate data, geographic data, etc.
